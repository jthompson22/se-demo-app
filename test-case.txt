What is different about this implementation?
1. Wild diveristy of outputs related to dynamic rendering of BlogMetrics for build. 
  A. Sometimes blog metrics are dynamic for both the index and post. 
  B. Usually (pretty much always) blog metrics are dynamic for Post but not index.
  C. Sometimes neither! So fun. 
  
  METHODS:
    - Added 's-maxage=900, stale-while-revalidate=31535100', to headers via next.config.js
    - Added suspense around BlogMetrics in index. 
    - Tried adding await headers in to index to force dynamic. 
    - Adding await connection() in to BlogMetrics does nothing.
